    <h4>My Late August Trip</h4>
    <p>This late august I went on a trip to various places with my friends. Here are some highlights:</p>

                <h3>Arctic Monkeys' Concert</h3>
                <p>
                    Arctic Monkeys is one of my favourite music bands, so I was absolutely thrilled to see them at the concert. They were performing at the Budweiser
                    Stage in Toronto. The place was totally packed! This was the first concert I've ever been to, and it was one of the best experiences of my life.
                    I had a lot of fun dancing and singing along to all the songs!
                </p>

                <h3>Niagara Falls</h3>
                <p>
                    We also visited Niagara Falls. I've been to Niagara before with my parents, but we decided to go there as well. Niagara Falls is definitely one of
                    my favourite cities in Canada. While the falls are wonderful, my favourite part of the city is actually the downtown area. It has such a nice vibe,
                    especially at night, and I just love it. It looks like a place straight out of a child's imagination. Very colourful and cheerful, had so much fun
                    in there too.
                </p>

                <h3>Tobermory</h3>
                <p>
                    After the concert and visiting Niagara Falls, we headed northwest towards Tobermory. Tobermory wasn't as exciting as the other two, but it was still
                    a pretty interesting part of our trip. We went kayaking on Lake Huron, visited a couple of parks, tried some local foods and pastries. I even saw a fox
                    right in the city! During one of the nights we stayed there we also saw the SpaceX Starlink satellites going by in the night sky.
